  <h2 class="post-title">Welcome</h2>

  <hr>

  <p>
  I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/" target="blank">Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>, where I organize the <a href="https://experimentalpolitics.github.io/" target="blank">Experimental Politics Lab</a>. During the 2019 academic year, I am a visiting research fellow at the <a href="http://methods.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/" target ="blank">Chair of Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/">University of Mannheim</a>. I received my PhD in political science from <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/" target="blank">Stony Brook University</a>. My research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of political attitudes, reasoning, and behavior. I am especially interested in the development and application of new statistical methods in the area of political psychology. For example, I use quantitative text analysis to study how citizens discuss and justify their political preferences and beliefs in open-ended survey responses as well as online discussions.

  Outside of academia, I enjoy cycling, hiking, climbing, and photography. I am also a fan of the German card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_%28card_game%29">Skat</a>. Here's a little <a href="http://pwkraft.shinyapps.io/Skat">Shiny app</a> that keeps track of our group's game statistics.
